"Although dogs are often referred to as "man’s best friend", dog bite injuries remain a significant public health concern. From 2005 to 2013, an average of 337,103 emergency department (ED) visits per year were attributed to dog bites in the United States.^1^ In 2018 alone, nearly 27,000 individuals required reconstructive surgery as a result of dog bite-related injuries.^2^

Our project aims to investigate the complex relationships between dog bite incidents and various factors, such as dog characteristics, geographical distribution, and trends over time. By examining dog bite rates in different zip code areas, we hope to pinpoint potential hotspots that can inform public safety measures. We’ll also look into whether specific traits of dogs—like breed, age, gender, and whether they are neutered - are linked to how often bites occur. This analysis could help in developing targeted strategies to reduce the risk of dog bites.
