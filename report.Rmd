## Motivation

Dogs are often cherished as "man's best friend," but the rising number of dog bite incidents poses a growing public health concern. In 2022, dog bites were among the top 15 causes of nonfatal emergency department visits across all age groups. This project explores the factors contributing to dog bite incidents, including dog-specific traits like breed, age, gender, and spay/neuter status, as well as their geographical patterns and trends over time. By analyzing bite rates across different zip code areas, we aim to identify hotspots and better understand the relationship between dog characteristics and bite frequency. The findings will support efforts to develop data-driven strategies for preventing dog bites and improving public safety.

## Related Work

We were inspired to perform this analysis after discovering dog bites data from the [NYC DOHMH](https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/ehr/registry/nycdohmh.htm). The New York State Department of Health (the Department) has been overseeing the health, safety, and well-being of New Yorkers since 1901 â€“ from vaccinations to utilizing new developments in science as critical tools in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. The data could be found on [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-Dog-Bite-Data/rsgh-akpg/about_data). Given that the dataset includes details such as the date of each dog bite, the borough, and various dog demographic variables, we saw this as an excellent opportunity to apply and explore the visualization and interactivity concepts covered in class.

## Initial Questions

We began by exploring trends in NYC dog bite incidents over time, along with their associations with dog demographics and spay/neuter status. We were interested in the following:

1. Which dog breeds are most frequently associated with dog bite incidents?

2. Has the incidence rate of dog bites shown a decline over the years?

3. Is the incidence rate of dog bites influenced by the dog's gender and neuter status?
